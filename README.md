| :- | :- |
|**Learning Objectives**|<p>- Utilise SQL, Python, and data analytics skills to uncover key learnings from a sample dataset.</p><p>- Create a presentation deck.</p><p>- Deliver a group presentation, clearly communicating analytical results.</p>|
|**BSM**|- All|

|**Team Structure**|- A group of 3-5 members |
|**Project Instructions and Deliverables**|<p>**You will work in your groups to answer a set of questions using the AdventureWorks dataset,** a demo dataset maintained by Microsoft. You will use your combined knowledge of SQL, Python, and data analytics to investigate the dataset and answer these questions: </p><p><br></p><p>1. **What are the regional sales in the best performing country?**</p><p><br></p><p>2. **What is the relationship between annual leave taken and bonus?**</p><p><br></p><p>3. **What is the relationship between Country and Revenue?**</p><p><br></p><p>4. **What is the relationship between sick leave and Job Title (PersonType)?**</p><p><br></p><p>5. **What is the relationship between store trading duration and revenue?**</p><p><br></p><p>6. **What is the relationship between the size of the stores, number of employees and revenue?**</p><p></p><p>You will answer these questions in a concise, informative, and accurately worded PowerPoint presentation that includes charts to support your findings.</p><p></p><p>When complete, you will need to submit your groups’ full project portfolio to your instructor for a group technical score. This portfolio should include the following deliverables:</p><p>1. A simple summary of open-source libraries comparison linked to project</p><p>2. A list of ideas generated, consisting of conceptual sketches, function, and key components</p><p>3. A simple written overview describing the database schema, table structure, and entity-relationship model</p><p>4. The source code for your solutions to finish this task </p><p>5. Final report that provides accurate answers to the questions, with charts (flexible format; can be a PowerPoint, document, etc.) </p><p></p><p>The class will have a total of twelve hours for groups to complete project tasks and deliverables; this includes time to research the presentation. Each group will deliver a 15 minute presentation using their final report, followed by 5-10 minutes of Q&A. Time is allocated for final presentation prep and rehearsal before the actual presentation. </p><p></p><p>**To get started:** Access the [AdventureWorks demo dataset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms); communicate with your instructor if you need assistance.</p>|
